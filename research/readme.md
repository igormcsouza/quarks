# Text Sentiment Analysis

## Database

The database is from a kaggle competition [imdb-ptbr](https://www.kaggle.com/luisfredgs/imdb-ptbr).
I choosed to work with my native language so it can be easily tested by my friends and family.
This database consists in a csv file with 4 columns, the id, the text in english, the text in
portuguese and the sentiment associeted with text. The sentiment is only **pos** or **neg**,
positive or negative respectively.
